  "title": "MGU-V: Music Generation Using Variational Autoencoders",
  "summary": "This paper introduces MGU-V, a novel music generation algorithm using a hybrid LSTM-VAE approach.  Trained on a custom dataset of over 2300 MIDI files, MGU-V generates realistic-sounding Lo-Fi music.  It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, demonstrating real-world applicability with 96.2% accuracy and 0.19 loss.",
