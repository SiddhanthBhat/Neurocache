  "title": "GRU Accuracy vs. Epochs",
  "summary": "This research presents a graph illustrating the accuracy of a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model over a varying number of epochs. The plot showcases an upward trend, indicating improved accuracy with increased training iterations.  The GRU model demonstrates a steady increase in performance, reaching approximately 90% accuracy after 20 epochs. This suggests effective learning and potentially good generalization capabilities of the model.",
