  "title": "ATHENA: Adaptive Tunable Hyper-Efficient Nonlinear Activation for Enhanced Deep Learning Performance",
  "summary": "This paper introduces ATHENA, a novel activation function designed to improve deep learning performance.  ATHENA addresses limitations of ReLU and its variants by providing smoother gradient flow and preventing the vanishing gradient problem.  Experimental results across various neural network architectures and datasets demonstrate ATHENA's superior performance compared to ReLU, Leaky ReLU, and other activation functions.",
