  "title": "VIPER: Variational Inference for Pattern Extraction and Recognition in Genomes using Deep Learning Cancer Detection",
  "summary": "VIPER is a novel deep learning framework for detecting cancer-causing mutations from genomic data.  It combines 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (Conv1D) with Mamba blocks (a structured state-space model) to capture local and long-range dependencies efficiently.  Evaluated on the Genome Screen Mutants VCF dataset, VIPER outperforms RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers in accuracy (97.30% validation), F1 score (97.13%), and computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale genomic analysis and precision oncology.",
